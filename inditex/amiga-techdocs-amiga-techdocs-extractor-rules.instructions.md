# AMIGA TechDocs Documentation Extractor Meta-Rule

## Objective

This meta-rule guides the systematic extraction of information from AMIGA TechDocs websites to generate accurate, verified clinerules for specific tools and technologies. **NO HALLUCINATIONS ALLOWED** - only documented, verifiable information.

**‚ö†Ô∏è FOUNDATION REQUIREMENT**: This meta-rule builds upon and extends the foundational principles established in `rules/meta/writing-effective-clinerules.md`. All generated clinerules **MUST** comply with the core principles, structure requirements, and best practices defined in that base document. This extractor adds AMIGA TechDocs-specific verification and extraction processes on top of those foundational requirements.

## üö® CRITICAL ANTI-HALLUCINATION INSTRUCTIONS üö®

### Core Verification Rules

‚úÖ **MUST verify every command, feature, or method exists in source documentation**
‚úÖ **MUST provide source URL/section for every extracted piece of information**
‚úÖ **MUST quote directly from documentation - NO paraphrasing without verification**
‚úÖ **MUST stop extraction if information cannot be verified**
‚úÖ **MUST mark unverified content as [UNVERIFIED - SKIP]**

‚ùå **NEVER assume features exist without explicit documentation**
‚ùå **NEVER extrapolate or infer capabilities not explicitly stated**
‚ùå **NEVER use examples from other tools without verification**
‚ùå **NEVER generate content without source attribution**

## Step 1: Source Collection and Validation

### 1.1 Mandatory Source Request

**ALWAYS start by asking:**
```
I need to create a clinerule for [TOOL_NAME]. Please provide:
1. GitHub repository URL with the documentation (preferred)
2. Official AMIGA TechDocs URL for this tool
3. Any specific documentation sections you want emphasized

I will prioritize direct documentation access over generic searches.
```

### 1.2 Source Verification Protocol

**For GitHub repositories:**
- Verify README.md exists and contains setup instructions
- Check for docs/ directory or wiki
- Identify configuration files and examples

**For AMIGA TechDocs sites:**
- Verify site accessibility
- Identify key navigation sections
- Locate Overview, Getting Started, Development and any other first level sections

**Fallback to Geppetto MCP only if:**
- Direct access fails
- Specific targeted searches needed
- Documentation gaps require filling

## Step 2: Systematic Information Extraction

### 2.1 Required Information Categories

**Extract ONLY if explicitly documented:**

**A. Basic Tool Information**
- Tool name and exact purpose (quote from docs)
- Installation commands (copy exactly)
- System requirements (if specified)

**B. Core Operations**
- Primary commands (exact syntax)
- Configuration file locations and names
- Directory structure requirements

**C. Critical Warnings and Notes**
- Warning boxes or callouts
- Breaking changes or version notes
- Required dependencies

**D. Integration Information**
- AMIGA framework integration steps
- Related AMIGA tools mentioned
- Inditex-specific configurations

### 2.2 Extraction Verification Checklist

Before recording any information, verify:
- [ ] Information appears in official documentation
- [ ] Commands/methods are explicitly documented
- [ ] Source section/URL is noted
- [ ] No assumptions or inferences made

**Evidence Format:**
```
EXTRACTED: [exact quote or command]
SOURCE: [URL#section or file:line]
VERIFIED: [date]
```

## Step 3: Clinerule Generation Process

**üìã FOUNDATION COMPLIANCE**: All generated clinerules MUST follow the structure, formatting, and best practices defined in `rules/meta/writing-effective-clinerules.md`. This includes proper frontmatter, clear objectives, structured content, and appropriate rule types.

### 3.1 Frontmatter Template (Based on Foundation Guide)

**Reference: `rules/meta/writing-effective-clinerules.md` Section 3 - Frontmatter for Metadata**

```yaml
---
description: [Tool purpose from official docs - clear and concise per foundation guide]
author: Generated from [SOURCE_URL]
version: 1.0.0
tags: ["[tool-name]", "amiga", "[additional-verified-tags]"]
globs: ["[verified-file-patterns]"] # File patterns where rule is relevant
source_documentation: "[PRIMARY_SOURCE_URL]"
extraction_date: "[DATE]"
---
```

### 3.2 Rule Structure Compliance

**Reference: `rules/meta/writing-effective-clinerules.md` Section 4 - Types of ClineRules**

**MUST determine and follow appropriate rule type:**
- **Informational/Documentation Rules**: For comprehensive tool information
- **Process/Workflow Rules**: For step-by-step procedures
- **Behavioral/Instructional Rules**: For AI guidance and constraints
- **Meta-Rules**: For rule management processes

### 3.3 Required Sections (Only if Information Available)

- Integration steps (if specified)
- Troubleshooting (if provided)

**If NOT documented, mark as:**
```
## [Section Name]
[NOT DOCUMENTED - Information not available in source documentation]
```

### 3.4 AI Behavioral Rules Section

**Reference: `rules/meta/writing-effective-clinerules.md` Section 5 - Language and Formatting for AI Guidance**

**Generate based on verified information only, following foundation formatting:**
```
## üö® CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR AI LANGUAGE MODELS üö®

‚úÖ **MUST [specific verified requirement]** # Use MUST for absolute requirements
‚úÖ **SHOULD [verified recommendation]** # Use SHOULD for strong recommendations

‚ùå **NEVER [specific documented constraint]** # Use NEVER for absolute prohibitions
‚ùå **SHOULD NOT [verified discouragement]** # Use SHOULD NOT for strong discouragement
```
